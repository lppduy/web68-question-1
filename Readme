** 1. Complete the creating task & marking as done behavior: **

- When user create a task with form submission, The list should be updated with new created entry.
- When user click the checkbox, item's status should be updated to "done" / "not finished"
  And the total number of undone tasks on top should be updated.

** 2. Show the not finished tasks only **

- Create a checkbox on top, saying "Not finished only". When it's checked, we show only the going tasks only.
- When it's unchecked, we show both done and not finsished tasks.
- Find a way to use URL to fast access the going tasks. For example: `<app-domain.com>?withDone=1` for getting all tasks (done tasks included)

** 3. Store all the tasks permantly and load them in the first place. **

All the task should be storaged inside the LocalStorage. When user first come to the app, we load everything from storage to the app.

** 4. Attach a due date to a task **

A task could have a due date for reminding later. Storage this information and show how many day left until the due date on each item.

** 5. Languague switching **
